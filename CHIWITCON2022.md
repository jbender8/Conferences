## Introduction  
Enova’s annual CHIWITCON event was held on Sept. 8 in Chicago. This was the first in-person CHIWITCON since 2019 due to the pandemic, and the main focus this year was reconnecting. The entire theme of the convenance was based on the idea of 're-.' Since returning to life after a pandemic there has been a lot that we have had to reconsider. [As CHIWITCON said](https://chiwomenintech.com/):

<blockquote> The hectic two years of a global pandemic have altered our work and home lives in no small measure. As we return to working together, navigating a mix of in-person and virtual spaces, each of us carries with us to work the impact of the time we spent apart. As we recalibrate our routines and adjust to yet another phase full of unknowns, how can we show up for each other (and ourselves) in the hybrid world? Join the powerful community of Chicago’s women technologists for this year’s CHIWITCON: Reconnect, a half-day of inspiring conversations and workshops designed to expand your network, broaden your community, and help you craft your narrative in this new chapter. </blockquote>

## Keynote Speakers  
The first speaker we heard from was [President and Co-Founder of i.c.stars, Sandee Kastrul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandeekastrul). She opened up with some facts about the world post pandemic. Did you know that 19% of people are miserable at work, and just 3 in 10 people are thriving in their well-being? Before the pandemic the world was like the Beyonce song 'Run the World (Girls),' and now its like 'Break My Soul.' Her 're-' word was to reinvigorate, which means to give new energy or strength to.  

Next, we heard from [CEO and Founder of Here Here Market, Disha Gulati](https://www.linkedin.com/in/disha-gulati). She focused on three 're-'s:' reimage, redefine, and recalibrate. She had some interesting words of wisdom to share: if you put something out there the universe will respond. As you climb up the ladder lift others with you. Schedule some time with people you have nothing to do with and build your network. You never know when a new connection will come about. 

The next speaker was [Professional Services Manager for Paradigm, Madeline Stone Kutis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madelinestonekutis). She discussed finding our true north. In order to do this we must move confidently in the direction of our goals. We must follow our mentors, as they are our guides. And sometimes we have to reorient and move back towards the light.

Lastly, we heard from [Director of Enterprise Strategy at Bullhorn, Kendra Cato](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kendracato/). She talked about connecting with people and encouraged that not everyone has to stay just "work friends." You never know when or where you might find new inspiration or where you might inspire someone else. Going the extra mile and putting yourself out there can lead to endless possibilities. Additionally, she really focused on remembrance, sharing a very heartful story about loss and leaving us with a quote by Maya Angelou - "If you only have one smile to give, give it to the people you love. Don't be surly at home, then go out in the street and start grinning 'Good morning' at total strangers."

## [ARA](https://aramentors.com/) Panel
The same four women, Sandee Kastrul, Disha Gulati, Madeline Stone Kutis, and Kendra Cato, answered some questions from the audience:  

- How to succeed during the virtual environment?
    - Taking the Meyers Briggs assessment as a team. This allows you and you manager to understand your different personality types. You can set intentions and goals based off that.
    - Going for a walk during 1-on-1's. Invite you and your partner to go outside and take a walk while you talk.
    - Play games virtually, for example, geocaching.
    - Host a virtual talent show

- What should you look for when ensuring a company has good DEI?
    - Budget: dedicated resources and time
    - Public statements
    - Pronouns in email signatures

- Is learning lacking with work from home?
    - You are no longer able to simply just look over at your neighbor’s computer screen
    - Projects are taking longer
    - But...implementing a buddy model for new hires and even new projects could be a way to bridge that gap.

- What has been the most challenging since the pandemic?
    - Understanding this new environment
    - More uncertainty
    - Not overcommitting, making small and informed goals

The last note they left us with was to ensure that you keep your career/professional goals separate from your work goals. Kill it in your current role but also step out of your comfort zone and be selfish. Ask yourself: what's the long game? What's the game plan now? Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

## Workshop: A Hero's Journey
A hero is defined as someone who found, achieved, or did something beyond the normal expectations. The last few years of work were beyond normal exactions, and to help re-tell your story, you will craft your own "hero's journey." This framework is like a map – it makes the journey a lot easier to navigate. Try and think of your own journey and develop your own story, as I share mine as well.  

__Act 1: The Departure__
- What was important to you prior to the pandemic?
- What did your work environment look like?
- What were your safe spaces?
- What did you lose?  

__Act 2: The Adaptation__
- Name any new friends or friendships that were strengthened
- Who/what was your biggest "villain?"
- What did you experiment with (routine, work set-up, self-care)?

__Act 3: The Return__
- What did you find out about yourself?
- What can you celebrate (new patterns of thinking, accomplishments, etc)?
- How are you preparing for additional change?
- What do you need for the sequel?

### A Hero’s Journey as told by Jess Bender:
<blockquote> As the pandemic hit I was wrapping my senior year of college. I was attending five in person classes and going to work in person at my university. I was ready with my full-time job offer from Discover. I really valued working in person and meeting new people. I felt the safest with my friends and family. However, March 2020 hit and I felt like I lost everything. No graduation, no senior breakfast, no formal, no finals (which I wasn’t too mad about), and no goodbyes. I packed up my college life and went home for what I (and a lot of other people) thought would only be two weeks. Now here we are two years later.  

This was very devastating for me. Everything that I envisioned for my life seemed to be over. I was honestly my biggest villain. I kept latching onto the idea of what was and what could have been. Moving forward was not easy. However, my family became some of my biggest supporters. I found myself growing closer to them. My family is a family of runners. We wake up on Thanksgiving and Christmas morning to run a 5k. I began to take it up myself, finishing my first ever 5k, 10k, and even 15k. Last summer I even challenged myself to run 600 miles in 3 months and I completed it.  

I found out that I don’t need as much human connection as I once thought I did. I learned how to be happy with just myself. I am ensuring that I am keeping myself physically and mentally in check to prepare myself for whatever curveball life might throw at me next. If nothing goes as planned, that is okay. </blockquote>
