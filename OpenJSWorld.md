The OpenJS Foundation annual event *OpenJS World 2022* was held June 6-10 in Austin, Texas. Pursuing the objective of "Growing JavaScript technology for all," *OpenJS World* brings a broad spectrum of members of the JavaScript ecosystem together into an agenda full of keynotes, breakout sessions, and interactive training workshops. Attendees learn and engage with community and industry leaders who are deploying innovative applications at a massive scale. 

Check out how the extended party of the DTA Experience Build Team - __Kevin Baugh__, __Michael Brewer__, __Samuel Diaz-Lopez__, __Kate Lorenzen__, __Peterson Ngo__, __Brian Pflum__, __Anh Pham__, __Jamaal Rogers__, __Manuel Silveyra__ and __Todd Sparkman__ - joined me, __Jess Bender__, for the sessions and festivities of *OpenJS World 2022*.

## Keynote Speakers

When it came to immediate relevance to Discover and the industry at large, the keynote addresses were on the money. Here's my takeaway.

In the welcome and opening remarks, Robin Bender Ginn, Executive Director of the OpenJS Foundation and Chris Gervang, Senior Visualization Engineer at Joby Aviation addressed the direct impact of all present on JavaScript, as 98% of the world's 1 billion+ websites use it. And OpenJS projects are critical to the web and beyond - Netflix and jQuery, to name a few, use OpenJS.

The *What's New in Web Standards* keynote was led by Christian Bromann of Stateful Inc., Jordan Harband of Coinbase, James Snell of Cloudflare, and Robin Bender Ginn. Speakers touched on "Misperceptions" about fixed standards, multiple standards, and that you can just make a new project and do better; the "Reality of lasting 500 years" in which things never last forever, are always changing, and no standards are permanent; about "When will JavaScript be finished" being *never*, as it will always need to be maintained; and "How to become an editor" involving the implementation of things in the browser, picking a proposal, understanding Java, and showing up with the willingness to learn.

In *The Human API: Building Your Project's Second Source of Truth*, keynote speaker Rachel Nabors of Amazon AWS Amplify emphasized deeply the importance of knowledge transfers and its relevance to all industries - and with that, the evolution of community engagement. Those around us in your community are our source of knowledge, and having an open line of communication with them is vital not only to our own success, but to theirs. We can and must pass along our knowledge. People learn by doing, so *keep trying* in order to *keep doing*. Let's grow ourselves by challenging ourselves and quizzing each other on what we have taken away. We can also improve our development by performing test-driven sample code. Ultimately, docs are our second source or truth: first are your sources - Our sources. This is community learning. 

Keynote *Moving from Awareness to Action: Creating Inclusive and Accessible Experiences* was delivered by NYU Professor Reginé Gilbert, who explained "web accessibility" as the design and development of websites, tools, and technologies for use by people with disabilities. This accessibility, more specifically, enables affected people to perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the web. Tim Berners-Lee: "The power of the Web is universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect." One in four individuals in the United States of America has a disability, which amounts to more than 61 million people. A few complete companies - Capital One, Dropbox, and Drupal, to name a few - have a culture of accessibility. This means that they think about including people with disabilities whenever they are in the process of making something, not simply when the thing is already finished. It also means they focus on the people who use their technology. Accessibility culture, therefore, has five key elements:
- Standards – companies follow guidelines set for accessibility
- Education – training employees on accessibility for their specific roles
- Accountability – teams are responsible for creating accessible content
- Inclusivity – hiring and working with people with disabilities (PWD)
- Personal responsibility – accessibility and inclusion is a part of everyone's job

## Breakout Sessions

Others commented on how great the breakout sessions were that they attended at *Open JS World*. Here are some that I enjoyed!

*The 90s Called and They Want Their Websites Back*, by Rachel White of Datadog. In this breakout session, we learned about and demoed the building of a react native app. Our presenter showed us about Photon, a web assembly or wasm that is 4-10 times faster and has over 90 functions. We used Fabric, which allows for image resizing and rotation along with drag and drop, image grouping, and moving layers up and down. Lastly, we were introduced to deploying using Netlify and GitHub.

*How We Help Make Web Standards*, by Eemeli Aro of Mozilla and Jordan Harband of Coinbase. We enjoyed a very casual chat in this breakout session with two developers who help build some of the JavaScript standards. The presenters revealed how they got involved in the endeavor and shared how we could get involved. Their biggest tip from experience? Complain to the maintainers and they will let you edit the code. For too long, people have shipped a product without due diligence, allowing issues to be addressed only when people complain about the product and tickets come in. The fact that there is open-source codes that still have bugs from the 1990s shows how people can get caught up in "arguing what color the bike is and not building the shed." The developers suggested instead the need for an approach of always coding with the future in mind and ensuring test-driven development. 

*Making Fetch Happen*, by Ethan Arrowood of Vercel. Fetches, as described by our presenter, refer to modern async patterns, class-based networking interfaces. In addition to being based on existing CORS standard, the Fetch API makes use of multiple other browser specifications including URL, streams, and AbortController. What's worth celebrating about Fetch? Isomorphic JavaScript is the concept of JavaScript code that can execute across different JavaScript environments. But we quickly run into issues with certain global values and APIS. 

## How the Linux Foundation is Handling COVID-19

The Linux Foundation took COVID-19 vary seriously. All attendees were required to show proof of vaccination upon registration along with a daily temperature check, and were required to wear masks throughout the conference. Two visual measures helped to decrease the concerns of attendees with interactions. A button that you added to your badge indicated your level of comfort with physical touch: a *green" button said you were okay with handshakes and high fives; a *yellow* button limited you to elbow touches; and the *red* button meant no touch at all. Similarly, stickers were provided to indicate your level of comfort with verbal conversation: *green* meant you were okay talking with everyone; *yellow* stood for talking only with people you know, and *red* indicated your discomfort talking with anyone. The extra steps taken by the Linux Foundation helped everyone to feel safe and comfortable communicating at the conference. 

## After Hours

The conference wasn't all learning. Check out how our team made sure that attendees got out on the town to explore Austin!

On flying in __Sunday__ afternoon, our team headed straight into Austin where we got BBQ, drank a beer with the goats, visited a place to raise our spirits, and had tableside smores as a team. On top of it all, we got to stay at the famously haunted Driskill Hotel in the heart of town! After class on __Monday__, we went to Central District Brewing and played a card game as a team; that night we went to the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema and watched *Pitch Perfect* - it was ACA-AWESOME! On __Tuesday__ we enjoyed the after-hours crawl of the conference booths while enjoying dinner, then went to a place for an evening of drinks and playing pool. A few of our team went on __Wednesday__ for a 3-mile running tour of the town; it was a great way to get in a morning workout while taking in the history behind a few key points about places in town. On __Wednesday__ evening, we went as a team to get pizza and watch a little of the conference's live band karaoke; we went on to a vendor's rooftop party and socialized with others who were attending the conference. On our last day, __Thursday__, we relaxed on our morning off by exploring the city one last time, and a few of us walked over to the Capitol; that evening, we went to the house of our manager, Manny, to enjoy a home-cooked meal and watch some movie classics. To end the trip, I went to ride a mechanical bull!

> "For me, the most interesting talks were unexpected. I didn't think I'd come across talks about Plato or rust language. These were definitely interesting to attend - but the one that most stood out to me was the talk by a Jarrod Connolly, who went into a fun project where he created a compiler in NodeJS. It wasn't that there was much need for another NodeJS compiler - the world has so many already - but his taking a language that isn't normally involved in creating a binary and using it intentionally to create a binary was intriguing. Conferences are a way for us to gain a view into how the rest of the world does something; they are a way to gain new ideas and see new technologies firsthand. I highly recommend that everyone attend every conference that they can."
